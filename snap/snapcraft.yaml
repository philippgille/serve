type: app # "app" is the default, but set it explicitly anyway

grade: stable # devel or stable. devel can't be published to the candidate or stable channels.
confinement: strict # devmode or strict. devmode snaps can't be published to the stable channel. strict leads to no access outside of declared interfaces through plugs.

# "Without specifying the base property in the snapcraft.yaml Snapcraft will operate in legacy mode,
# which is essentially a 2.4X old version of Snapcraft and will lose the functionalities and bug fixes introduced in the new version".
#
# Maybe "bare" might be a better fit in the future, but it's currently not supported in snapcraft/snapd.
# "Bare" might also require serve to be compiled with CGO_ENABLED=0 and/or "netgo" + "osusergo" compile flags and/or `-extldflags "-static"` and/or more.

# There currently seem to be several issues with cross compiling a snap with the go plugin.
# Without this, and without "--target-arch=...", the snap will be built for the same arch the build is running on.
# In the future we should check for updates of snapcraft and revisit this option.

    # When using a recent version of snapcraft, building a snap is done in a VM which is currently Ubuntu 18.04,
    # so even when using an older Ubuntu 16 as host, at least Go 1.10 is used.
